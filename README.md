# CST8227 Touch Sensor
Arduino code for a Teensy3.2 microcontroller circuit demonstrating the following  
1. Experiment with a capacitive touch sensor as an input device.  
2. Run a calibration routine that detects minimum and maximum values.  
3. Send an output signal to a piezo buzzer (or LED) that is proportional to the input from the sensor input.
